#### Deploying your machine learning models into production

In this accelerator we have so far learned how to log, register, load and use a machine learning model in your data warehouse. The final step is putting these models into production, this can be done:

* In batch or streaming
  * Using a standard Databricks's notebook job
  * Delta Live Table pipeline
* In real-time over a REST API, deploying MLflow model serving capabilities

#### **Option 1:** Databricks notebook scheduling
The example notebook shown earlier in this accelerator showed how you could load and use your models. This notebook can be triggered to run on a schedule by either creating a [workflow job](https://docs.databricks.com/workflows/jobs/jobs.html) or setting up a schedule from within the notebook itself.

#### **Option 2:** Delta Live Tables
If you are using a DLT pipeline, add the steps to load and use your model into your pipeline notebook. See [Delta Live Tables introduction](https://docs.databricks.com/workflows/delta-live-tables/index.html) for more information.

#### **Option 3:** MLflow model serving REST API

The following steps illustrate how to issue requests using a REST API to get predictions from your deployed model using [MLflow model serving](https://docs.databricks.com/mlflow/model-serving.html).

1. Navigate to your model in the Databricks model registry and click **Enable Serving** for your model.

2. Send a request from the UI to validate model serving. Click on **Show Example** to populate the request content with the model example that was logged with your model.

3. Click on the **Python** tab under *Call the model* and copy the python code snippet. This function enables you to use the model outside of Databricks.

As a security best practice, when authenticating with automated tools, systems, scripts, and apps, Databricks recommends you use access tokens belonging to service principals instead of workspace users. For more information, see [Manage service principles](https://docs.databricks.com/administration-guide/users-groups/service-principals.html).

  ds_dict = dataset.to_dict(orient='split') if isinstance(dataset, pd.DataFrame) else create_tf_serving_json(dataset)
  data_json = json.dumps(ds_dict, allow_nan=True)
  response = requests.request(method='POST', headers=headers, url=url, data=data_json)

    raise Exception(f'Request failed with status {response.status_code}, {response.text}')
  return response.json()
