#### Train predictive model using LightGBM and MLflow

This propensity to convert solution provides a very flexible way to identify who among your audience is most likely to actually engage with you, for example request a demo / sign up for a trial, purchase a first service/product, request an upgrade, accept an offer etcâ€¦

Import this notebook into your Databricks workspace to run this model for yourself (see how to [Import a notebook](https://docs.databricks.com/notebooks/notebooks-manage.html#import-a-notebook)).
