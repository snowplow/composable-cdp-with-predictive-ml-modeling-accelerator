#### Train predictive model using LightGBM and MLflow

This propensity to convert solution provides a very flexible way to identify who among your audience is most likely to actually engage with you, for example request a demo / sign up for a trial, purchase a first service/product, request an upgrade, accept an offer etcâ€¦

Clone this [notebook](https://github.com/snowplow/composable-cdp-with-predictive-ml-modeling-accelerator/blob/main/content/predictive_ml_models/snowflake/static/snowflake_training_model.ipynb) into your own workspace to run this model for yourself.
